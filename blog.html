            <div class="p-3">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Local Storage:</h5>
              <p class="card-text">With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
              </p>
              <p>Local and session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They
                allow a website to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on.</p>
              <p>Depending on your needs, you can use local or session storage to store data. Both storage methods are
                similar to cookies but without the same privacy concerns surrounding cookies. Therefore, most modern
                websites prefer to use web storage methods only or combine them with cookies as a fallback.

                Unlike cookies, local storage and session storage do not send data to the server via HTTP headers. You
                should use them for client-side functionality only.

                Additionally, local and session storage each have a storage limit of around 5 MB per domain. They
                provide more storage than cookies, which only have a capacity of 4 KiB per cookie</p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Session Storage:</h5>
              <p>A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a bit,
                then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser configuration
                may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you interact with a
                site.</p>
              <p>Session storage is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site,
                you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in your
                browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a
                "session"</p>

            <div class="p-3">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Global Scope:</h5>
              <p class="card-text">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while
                in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if
                statements, for statements, and the like.</p>
              <p>JavaScript ES6 has different ways to declare and use variables. This often leds to confusion about when
                to use which keyword, in this article I have made this easy to figure out when to use which keyword.</p>
              <p>In order to know which keyword to use we must first know about the scope in javascript. As the name
                says it scope means which variable is accessible and upto which point it is accessible.
                So, in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are
                contained in this global scope.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</h5>
              <p>A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are
                accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly braces are called as within block scope.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the use of keywords,
                var is called as function scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be
                accessible throughout the function.</p>
              <p>let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.
                Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is
                used for a variable which doesn't change till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout
                the program.</p>

            <div class="p-3">
              <p class="card-text">The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS
                executes
                all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                multi-threading. Let's take a look at what happens on the back-end.</p>
              <p>The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever
                a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
              <p>The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.</p>
              <p>Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                browser.
                Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

                An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it
                is
                sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for
                processing.

                Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate
                threads.

                The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If
                it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call
                is
                processed.</p>

            <div class="p-3">
              <h6>There are 8 ways to get undefined</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>
                <li>Function with no return</li>
                <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
                <li>If return has nothing on the right side wil return undefined</li>
                <li>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined</li>
                <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range</li>
                <li>Deleting an element inside an array</li>
                <li>et a value directly to undefined.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
                value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.</p>
              <p>In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is
                not the case, avoid overriding it.)

                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
              <p>However, there is another alternative. JavaScript is a statically scoped language, so knowing if a
                variable is declared can be read by seeing whether it is declared in an enclosing context.</p>
              <p>The global scope is bound to the global object.</p>
