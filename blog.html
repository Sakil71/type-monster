            <div class="p-3">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Local Storage:</h5>
              <p class="card-text">With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
              </p>
              <p>Local and session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They
                allow a website to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on.</p>
              <p>Depending on your needs, you can use local or session storage to store data. Both storage methods are
                similar to cookies but without the same privacy concerns surrounding cookies. Therefore, most modern
                websites prefer to use web storage methods only or combine them with cookies as a fallback.

                Unlike cookies, local storage and session storage do not send data to the server via HTTP headers. You
                should use them for client-side functionality only.

                Additionally, local and session storage each have a storage limit of around 5 MB per domain. They
                provide more storage than cookies, which only have a capacity of 4 KiB per cookie</p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Session Storage:</h5>
              <p>A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a bit,
                then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser configuration
                may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you interact with a
                site.</p>
              <p>Session storage is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site,
                you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in your
                browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a
                "session"</p>

            <div class="p-3">
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Global Scope:</h5>
              <p class="card-text">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while
                in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if
                statements, for statements, and the like.</p>
              <p>JavaScript ES6 has different ways to declare and use variables. This often leds to confusion about when
                to use which keyword, in this article I have made this easy to figure out when to use which keyword.</p>
              <p>In order to know which keyword to use we must first know about the scope in javascript. As the name
                says it scope means which variable is accessible and upto which point it is accessible.
                So, in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are
                contained in this global scope.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h5 class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</h5>
              <p>A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are
                accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly braces are called as within block scope.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the use of keywords,
                var is called as function scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be
                accessible throughout the function.</p>
              <p>let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.
                Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is
                used for a variable which doesn't change till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout
                the program.</p>
